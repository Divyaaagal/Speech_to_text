This .py will let you convert your speech to text. My use case was to convert hindi speech to text. If you want to change the language you can edit the language in 

**text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio, language="hi-IN")**

**PS: commented code be used to get the list of devices available on your system.**

**Installations:**

```python
pip install SpeechRecognition

```
```python
pip install PyAudio

```
```python
pip install pywin

```
